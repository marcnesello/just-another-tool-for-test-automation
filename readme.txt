Purpose
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This tool can be used for automated system tests of command line applications. 
Test lists are written in a xml-style syntax. 
The tool is developed in Perl with a portion of code in xml scheme to validate test lists.


This tool needs a perl interpreter. For Windows I recommend Strawberry Perl (http://strawberryperl.com/), because all necessary modules are installed with Strawberry Perl.

If you want to use another perl interpreter, ensure that following modules are installed:

XML::LibXML - (http://search.cpan.org/~pajas/XML-LibXML-1.70/LibXML.pod)
threads - (http://search.cpan.org/~jdhedden/threads-1.77/threads.pm)
File::Path - (http://search.cpan.org/~dland/File-Path-2.08/Path.pm)
File::Temp - (http://search.cpan.org/~tjenness/File-Temp-0.22/Temp.pm)

1.Content
Files:
readme.txt - This file
gpl-2.0.txt - The GNU GPL v2
jatta.pl - The main program
jatta.xsd - The XML Schema file

Folders:
modlib - Contains the perl modules which are needed to run jatta.pl
example_win - Contains example test files for Windows and example results and logs
example_linux - Contains example test files for Linux and example results and logs

2.Building the documentation
For rebuilding the documentation you need doxygen and as input_filter you need DoxyGen::Filter which processes the perl sources.

3.Usage
1.Write a Test list
Write a test list which is valid according to jatta.xsd. Example test lists are found in example_win and example_linux.

2.Start Just Another Tool for Test Automation
At your terminal type "perl jatta.pl FILENAME". Substitute FILENAME with the complete path to the test file.
